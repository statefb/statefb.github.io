For a large, heavily regulated industry, this task can not only be daunting, but viewed by many as impossible. Often, organizations try to reduce the friction through micro-fixes, but Eddie’s team asked how to change the culture to reduce the friction and concluded with the following final points:

I believed that recipe searching app that offers tagging function is convenient as shown in the above gif animation, which motivated me to develop.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Time Warping</title><link>https://statefb.github.io/projects/creations/dtw/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 12:41:05 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://statefb.github.io/projects/creations/dtw/</guid><description>Comprehensive dynamic time warping module for python.

If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;quot; attack.</description></item><item><title>Search Results</title><link>https://statefb.github.io/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://statefb.github.io/search/</guid><description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
