This web application enables us to search and show recipes tweeted on twitter by your favorite recipe developer.  
Currently not open to public.

### Motivation

Recently japanese cooking specialists tend to publish their recipe on SNS e.g. Twitter and Youtube.
In daily cooking it's important to use stock in refrigerator, however, Twitter is not optimized to search recipe by ingredients.
I believed that recipe searching app that offers tagging function is convenient as shown in the above gif animation, which motivated me to develop.
